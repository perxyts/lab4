Hello! For my project I decided to try to implement a machine learning handwriting recognition code. 
Hopefully, it'll actually be able to decipher handwriting accurately but if not it'll at least be funny

So, the way i'm hoping to organize this is to have a main branch which contains code that actually works and at least one side branch
Especially since I might be working with programs like OpenCV, which might mess up my repository, I decided to be pretty careful about what gets put on the main branch
Im a wyoming gramps
